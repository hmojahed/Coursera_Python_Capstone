We picked the highest accuracy model.
Also in confusion matrix, ignore the true positive and true negatives. 
Look at False Positive which determines the worse models (because you cannot afford predicting something would land, but in reality it would not land)
False Negatives are less problematic, because we predicted that it would not land (kinda a negative outcome), but to our surprise it landed (good outcome).
